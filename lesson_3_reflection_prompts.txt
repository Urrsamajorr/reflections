When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to make a quick change without affecting your local copy for any particular reason.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So that when multiple people are working on a project, they are not getting on-the-fly changes.
